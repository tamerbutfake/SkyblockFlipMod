Hi.This file is to guide those who want to contribute to this project.First please message me on discord:"tamersaykal".My expectations arent too high but it whould be better if its optimized because of the limited resources users might have and the api request limit.
If i ever decide to advertise this mod i whould need to use a developer api key but i dont know how i can use that api without hardcoding it into the code.I dont want to make a wrapper and make my own api and rent a server for this so if you can help me out on that it whould be great.
