Hi.This file is to guide those who want to contribute to this project.First please message me on discord.
My expectations aren't too high but it whould be better if the code is optimized because of the limited resources users might have and the api request limit.
If i ever decide to advertise this mod or more people starts using this mod i whould need to use a developer api key.
But i dont know how i can use that api without hardcoding it into the code.
I dont want to make a wrapper for the api and come up with my own endpoint because i dont have the money and time to rent a server and maintain it so if you can help me out on this it whould be great.
