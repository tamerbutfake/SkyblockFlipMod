This is an auction flipper mod for Hypixel Skyblock and this mod will be available for everyone and will not be advertised(at least for now).

About me: Im kind of new to java. Im familiar with the syntax because its very similar to C and i watched a tutorial series on youtube. Im not too bad at programming in general but im not so good at java.So dont expect too much from me. Even tough i can probably finish this project just by myself it will take a long time and i want to get some collaborating experience. Also if more people starts using this mod i will have a problem that i cannot solve by myself(mentioned in the readme_to_developers file).

I appriciate any help and please read the READMO_TO_DEVELOPER file if you want to collaborate.
